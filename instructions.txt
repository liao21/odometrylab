Intro to Odometry. 

    Use your lab 2 code to follow a line/loop.
    Estimate your distance traveled using wheel encoders.
    Compare this number to ground truth and the robotâ€™s distance reported.


    Deliverables: 

        How many ticks on the encoder per wheel revolution while traveling slowly?
        Estimate wheel slippage as a % by going very slow and very fast.  Is the distance measurement accurate?
        Also note if your wheels (left vs right) behave differently.  Can you quantify it?


Upload your results or a summary of progress.

This could be a good foundation for the course project if you want to integrate optical flow and try to more realistically measure the distance of a line or loop.
